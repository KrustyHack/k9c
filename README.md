# `k9c` â€“ Cloud9+kubectl container

This repository has build script and deployment manifest for a container that has Cloud9 IDE and `kubectl` installed
(along with other handy packages), it's intended to be used for training/workshops, as it can run as a pod in cluster
so all attendees need is a browser.
